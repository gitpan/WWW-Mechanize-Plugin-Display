NAME
    WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Display - Display WWW::Mechanize results in a
    local web browser.

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Mechanize;
      use WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Display;

      my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new;
      $mech->get('http://www.google.com');
      $mech->display;

DESCRIPTION
    When you get an unexpected result while using WWW::Mechanize, it can be
    useful to inspect the current page that Mechanize has fetched in a local
    browser.

    This plugin adds a method for that, depending on HTML::Display for most
    of the work.

    It should work with WWW::Mechanize, or any sub-class of it.

  display()
        $mech->display();

    Display the current HTML content in a local browser.

    A quick example of setting a preferred browser:

     PERL_HTML_DISPLAY_COMMAND=w3m -T text/html %s

    See HTML::Display for configuration details.
